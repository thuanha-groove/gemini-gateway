# Active Context

## What I'm Working On Now

My current task is to initialize the `cline_docs` Memory Bank for this project. This involves creating the required documentation files (`productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `progress.md`, and `activeContext.md`) and populating them with information gathered from the project's `README.md` and file structure.

## Recent Changes

*   Created the `cline_docs` directory.
*   Created and populated `cline_docs/productContext.md`.
*   Created and populated `cline_docs/techContext.md`.
*   Created and populated `cline_docs/systemPatterns.md`.
*   Created and populated `cline_docs/progress.md`.
*   Created and populated this file, `cline_docs/activeContext.md`.
*   Updated the `README.md` to be more comprehensive.

## Next Steps

With the Memory Bank now initialized, the next step is to await further instructions from the user. The project is now fully documented according to the `clinerules`, and I am ready to proceed with any development, troubleshooting, or enhancement tasks.
